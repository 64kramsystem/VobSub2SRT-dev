VobSub2SRT is a simple command line program to convert =.idx= / =.sub= subtitles into =.srt= text subtitles by using OCR. It is based on code from the [[http://www.mplayerhq.hu][MPlayer project]] - a really really great movie player. [[http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/][Tesseract]] is used as OCR software.

vobsub2srt is released under the GPL3+ license. The MPlayer code included is GPL2+ licensed.

The quality of the OCR depends on the text in the subtitles. Currently the code does not use any preprocessing. But I'm currently looking into adding filters and scaling options to improve the OCR. You can correct mistakes in the =.srt= files with a text editor or a special subtitle editor.

* Building
You need tesseract and libavutil (part of the [[http://ffmpeg.org/][FFmpeg]] project). You also need cmake and a gcc to build it. With Ubuntu 12.04 you can install the dependencies with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo apt-get install libavutil-dev libtiff4-dev libtesseract-dev tesseract-ocr-eng build-essential cmake pkg-config
#+END_EXAMPLE

You should also install the tesseract data for the languages you want to use! Note that the support for tesseract 2 is deprecated and will be removed in the future!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
#+END_EXAMPLE

This should install the program vobsub2srt to =/usr/local/bin=. You can uninstall vobsub2srt with =sudo make uninstall=. If you want to install the bash completion script then set the =BASH_COMPLETION_PATH= parameter:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ./configure -DBASH_COMPLETION_PATH="$BASH_COMPLETION_DIR"
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Static binary
I recommend using the dynamic binary. However if you really need a static binary you can add the flag =-DBUILD_STATIC=ON= to the =./configure= call. But be aware that building static binaries can be quit troublesome. You need the static library files for tesseract, libtill, avutils, and for their dependencies as well. On Ubuntu 12.04 the static libraries are only included in the dev packages! You probably also need the Gold linker.

For Ubuntu 12.04 you need the following extra packages:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo apt-get install libleptonica-dev libpng12-dev libwebp-dev libgif-dev zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev binutils-gold
#+END_EXAMPLE

If linking fails with undefined references then checking what other dependencies your version of leptonica has is a good starting point. You can do this by running =ldd /usr/lib/liblept.so= (or whatever the path to leptonica is on your system). Add those dependencies to =CMakeModules/FindTesseract.cmake=.

** .deb (Debian/Ubuntu)
You can build a *.deb package (Debian/Ubuntu) with =make package=. The package is created in the =build= directory.

** Homebrew
Vobsub2srt contains a formula for [[http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/][Homebrew]] (a package manager for OS X). It can be installed by using the command =brew install https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT/raw/master/packaging/vobsub2srt.rb=.

** Gentoo ebuild
An [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebuild][ebuild]] for Gentoo Linux is also available. You can make it available to emerge with the following steps

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/media/video/vobsub2srt/
  wget https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT/raw/master/packaging/vobsub2srt-9999.ebuild
  sudo mv vobsub2srt-9999.ebuild /usr/local/portage/media/video/vobsub2srt/
  cd /usr/local/portage/media/video/vobsub2srt/
  sudo ebuild vobsub2srt-999.ebuild digest
#+END_EXAMPLE

You should be able to install vobsub2srt with =emerge vobsub2srt= now. If you want to use a newer version (3+) of tesseract you have to use layman. See [[https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT/issues/13][#13]] for details.
** Arch AUR
There also exist a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD][PKGBUILD]] file for Arch Linux in AUR: [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=50015]]
* Usage
vobsub2srt converts subtitles in VobSub (=.idx= / =.sub=) format into subtitles in =.srt= format. VobSub subtitles consist of two or three files called =Filename.idx=, =Filename.sub= and optional =Filename.ifo=. To convert subtitles simply call

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  vobsub2srt Filename
#+END_EXAMPLE

with =Filename= being the file name of the subtitle files *WITHOUT* the extension (=.idx= / =.sub=). vobsub2srt writes the subtitles to a file called =Filename.srt=.

If a subtitle file contains more than one language you can use the =--lang= parameter to set the correct language (Use =--langlist= to find out about the languages in the file).

If you want to dump the subtitles as images (e.g. to check for correct ocr) you can use the =--dump-images= flag.

Use =--help= or read the manpage to get more information about the options of vobsub2srt.
