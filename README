VobSub2SRT is a simple command line program to convert .idx/.sub subtitles into .srt text subtitles by using OCR. It is based on code from the MPlayer project (http://www.mplayerhq.hu) - a really really great movie player. Tesseract (http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) is used as OCR software.

vobsub2srt is released under the GPL3+ license. The mplayer code included is GPL2+ licensed.

Currently the OCR results are more or less useless. But this should improve with correct preprocessing.

* Building
You need tesseract and libavutil (part of the ffmpeg project). You also need cmake and a gcc to build it. With Ubuntu 10.04 you can install the dependencies with

  sudo apt-get install libavutil-dev tesseract-ocr-dev tesseract-ocr-eng build-essential cmake

You should also install the tesseract data for the languages you want to use (currently only english is supported). vobsub2srt can be build by using

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

This should install the program vobsub2srt to /usr/local/bin. You can uninstall vobsub2srt with "sudo make uninstall".

* Usage
vobsub2srt converts subtitles in VobSub (.idx/.sub) format into subtitles in .srt format. VobSub subtitles consist of two or three files called Filename.idx, Filename.sub and optional Filename.ifo. To convert subtitles simply call

  vobsub2srt Filename

with Filename being the filename of the subtitle files WITHOUT the extension (.idx/.sub). vobsub2srt writes the subtitles to a file called Filename.srt.

* To Do
- implement preprocessing (first step scaling. Code available in spudec.c)
- implement support for indices (languages)
- add more cmd options and parse them properly
